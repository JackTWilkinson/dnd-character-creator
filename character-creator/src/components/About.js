		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my React project! This fun little app was made to help me
			practice react and a few of its associated libraries in a way that would
			produce something a little bit more "useful" than a simple hello world
			program! This project was made in the nano-react project environment and uses
			several additional libraries in order to add a bit more flavor/styling
			to the site. A special thanks to Kaden Kilburg for porting the dice model
		    to zdog-react from zdog common.</p><br/>
		<h3>Extra Libraries Used</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>react-router</li>
			<li>react-zdog</li>
			{/*	TODO Update as the app is completed more */}
		</ul>
